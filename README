== Userpoints Evaporate ==

This module implements a cron hook that simply subtracts a set number of
userpoints from each entry in the {userpoints} table every set interval.

It does this by running a single SQL query.

== Caveats ==

The {userpoints_txn} table is not updated when points evaporate.
