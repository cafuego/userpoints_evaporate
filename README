== Userpoints Evaporate ==

This module implements a cron hook that simply subtracts a set number of
userpoints from each entry in the {userpoints} table every set interval.

It also writes proper records to the {userpoints_txn} table, so users can
see when and how many points have evaporated.

It does this by running two SQL queries via hook_cron.


== Requirements ==

To make use of userpoints_evaporate you will need to install the userpoints
module. http://drupal.org/project/userpoints  You must also periodically
run the Drupal cron script.


== Installation ==

Extract the module to sites/*/modules and enable it via the module admin
page.


== Configuration ==

Browse to http://localhost/?q=admin/settings/userpoints_evaporate to change
evaporation settings.
