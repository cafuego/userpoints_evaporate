== Userpoints Evaporate ==

This module implements a cron hook that simply subtracts a set number of
userpoints from each entry in the {userpoints} table every set interval.

It also writes proper records to the {userpoints_txn} table, so users can
see when and how many points have evaporated.

It does this by running two SQL queries via hook_cron.
